Being new to programming, I will definitely want to make sure I have the time to process and understand the correct implementation of this project. The most valuable takeaway for me is to get more comfortable with how to code and the many nuances of programming. I expect this RSA project to be very challening but am anticipating lots of insights to be gained. The table of contents will follow the default format: First Toolset (Convert_Text, Convert_Num, Convert_Binary String) Second Toolset (div_alg, FME, Euclidean_Alg) Third Toolset (Finding Private and Public Keys) Fourth Toolset (Encoding and Decoding Messages) and lastly wrapping it all up into one main function with all previous functions defined. I will doing everything on the jupyter hub as I don't have much familiarity with other IDEs.  Following the answers to project questions will be the factorize and factorize better functions and lastly, the conclusion. Here....we...go... &gt;</font>"

    "<font color=blue>&lt;Phew!! This RSA project was no joke (not that I thought it would be). Though my RSA algorithms didn't churn out perfect results, I'm quite pleased with my progress in understanding not only RSA but python coding (This assignment was definitely harder than any of the CSCI 1300 HW assignments thus far). On Friday (3/15), even though my code wasn't up and running as smoothly as the finished product, I was able to start cracking the codes with provided private keys. I chose test my code with Samuel Cramer's crypted message. From his previous piazza messages, he seems to be a particularly bright student with a good sense of humor and I was actually interested in what type of message he would encrypt. I'll have to admit, the first time I went through the crytic messages, I was lost and completely bewildered lol. Maybe it was because it was a Friday but it took me at least 30 minutes before I was finally to understand the path from message to getting the ascii integer list and then converting the list into letters/words. I felt tremendous relief when the cyphered text actually returned coherent words and not just shapes and symbols which I routinely got in the beginning (due to using incorrect inputs for the FME algorithm). I was never able to get my functions to take an entire list of cyphered numbers and return a sentence. Instead, I resorted to manually going through the each number followed by commas and going through the steps one by one. Again, I think I'll continue to refer to this assignment in Jupyter and as my coding/knowledge progresses, I want to be able to configure the code how I intended where I can copy/paste a list of coded messages and have the algorithm return a simple message print statement. Samuel's eventual message read \"Sirens of Titan is my favorite book, I recommend it.\"  I haven't actually read the book yet, so I get to working on my coded response. I used the Convert_Text function to get the ascii integers associated with the text \"Cool. I'll add to my list.\" From there, I went through the process of encrypting the message. I wish I either had more time or a better understanding the implementation of these functions since I would have definitely enjoyed a more engaging exchange. However, I knew if I was limited by going through each step manually, I would be using up previous time to be used to ensure I complete the project to the best of my ability. Following my response, I made sure to post my public messages without private keys for other students to break. As of my writeup, I have not received a response. Again, my code has improved significanty since Friday so I'm sure I could now write more engaging comments/responses. My messages were related to sports predictions (NFL - BROWNS Super Bowls Champs for next year and the use of the Nike slogan). I continued to look for piazza posts with public and private keys to generate some confidence and understanding of deciphering messages. I chose to take a look at the instructor's message which generated ascii values [34, 73, 116, 32, 108, 111, 118, 101, 100, 32, 116, 111, 32, 104, 97, 112, 112, 101, 110, 46, 34] and the string \"It loved to happen,\" a famous Marcus Aurelius quote. My response, from the movie Gladiator with the character Marcus Aurelius, stated \"I will have my vengeance. In this life or the next.\" A chose another message from the instructor with the deciphered message: \"Be Curious Not Afraid.\" At this point, I started to get a pretty grasp on going back and forth between encoding and decoding and encoded my response \"Curiosity Killed the cat.\"  Most challenging for me was the Find_private_key_d function which I admittedly needed help with and also working on wrapping up all the functions into one coherent \"main\" function. Being new to coding, python, everything...I found every step along the way satisfying. The challenge obviously grew as the toolsets progressed and I found myself working harder and longer through each successive one. The most satisfying aspect was decoding the messages. I was worried I wouldn't get to that point and not be able to post anything for contribution. No particular student helped me but it was definitely helpful working along the homework assignments and incrementally gaining understanding of RSA. Aside from lectures, I referenced https://iinurmi.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/rsa-encryption-private-and-public-key-calculation/ continuously to keep familiarizing myself with RSA as the entire concept was not intuitive for me. I never knew a school assignment could be so challenging, frustrating, surprising, fun all in one. It was a great learning experience/tool and I intend to continue modifying this code as my skills progress&gt;</font><br>"

    "<font color=blue>&lt;I started with Amanda Killeen's message. I honestly did not think I stood a chance at breaking the code without the private key. That algorithm caused me a lot of pain/grief and time and as annotated in my comments for that finding private key d, I resorted to online tutorials for understanding how to implement the extended Euclidean algorithm for getting a defined private key. So, at first glance, even the her message was relatively short (around 16 characters), it took a while before I got the ball rolling. Obviously I had to define my private key function so I had something to work with. I first used the factorize_n function to determine p and q values. I was eventually able to implement a modular inverse type function. The first four tries or so, I kept on getting ascii integers which were way too many digits and resulting in text conversions that didn't make sense. So this took a lot of trial and error and seeing why I was getting the wrong values for d. Eventually I ended on a working private key function using values e and (p-1)*(q-1) I was able to get the ascii values [89, 111, 117, 39, 114, 101, 32, 109, 121, 32, 98, 111, 121, 32, 66, 108, 117, 101, 33] which I then converted to \"You're my boy Blue!\" Not gonna lie, I was pretty ecstatic when I saw the converted message as Old School is a cult classic. I posted in a piazza response the song played during the funeral scene where Will Ferrel's character, Frank the Tank, agonizes and says the famous line. My next attempt was from student Isaac Haames. Isaac's n and e values were smaller than Amanda's message and so I was hoping this one would require less effort as I knew I had to really work through the rest of the RSA project and the get the pieces working and finalized. With n = 299 and e = 169 I was able to factorize n = 13 and derive q = 23/ With these values I took the same process as before and got the deciphered message \"Isn't RSA fun?\" As for finding out how large numbers need to be before I received error \"int too large to find float\", I got to 310 characters.&gt;</font><br>"

    "<font color=blue>&lt;My observations on RSA from the HW assignment talked about my amazement towards RSA, especially deriving the private key and comparing the keys to complementary light colors. My views on the complexity of private key has only been illuminated from this project since I found deriving the private key value to be a tremendous challenge while using the extended Euclidean algorithm. I also mentioned in the homework how as the value of the keys grow, the time constraint to solve for the values grows. This was seen in the brute force factorizing of n where it takes longer to derive each value it spans many integers. Going from writing the homework assignments by hand to watching the lectures and not understanding what was happening at times, I felt this project was an enormous undertaking but feel RSA is something I can continue to delve into and learn to understand better. This provide provided a definite framework and template for breaking down RSA into manageable sections and building it back up into what makes sense for me given my limited experience. As stated, I would definitely like to improve these algorithms later down the road to derive more efficient codes and altogether better understanding of RSA. The main function still gives me issues and I definitely want to revisit the main code for when I get a better grasp on functions. &gt;</font><br>"
